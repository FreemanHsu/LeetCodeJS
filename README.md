#LeetCode in Javascript

LeetCode Collection in Javascript.

Tool scripts for testing are added.

The reason for doing this is that I am poor at thinking of valuable test cases, thus I always relied on leetcode judging system to remind me of boundary conditions, which is not decent at all.

Besides, it is not so interesting to write test scripts but I think the ability of automatic testing is of importance for front-end developers.

### Let's Leet
```
npm run leet
```
Automatically setup a new leetcode according to current progress, including:

+ A directory named like 001-Two-Sum
+ index.js
+ test.js
+ input
+ output

### Test
Complete the test.js and test cases (input and output files) and
```
npm test
```
